#PYTHON ASSIGNMENT
#Differentaite between Mutable and Immutables Data types in Python

#Mutable is a type of variable that can be changed.
#A mutable object is an object whose state/value can be modified after it is created. 
#Some of the mutable data types in python are list, dictionary, set and user-defined classes.

#Immutables are the objects whose state/content cannot be changed once the object is created.
#  An object can be immutable for various reasons,
#for example:
#     • To improve performance (no planning for the object's future changes)
#     • To reduce memory use (make object references instead of cloning the whole object)
#     • Thread-safety (multiple threads can reference the same object without interfering with one other)
# Strings and Numbers are Immutable.
#Some of the immutable data types are integers, float, decimal, boolean, strings, tuple and rage.
#Once they are initialized, their values cannot be changed.

#For example, Comparing the tuple(immutable) and list(mutable) data types. 
#We can define a list using 'square brackets' [] like this: numbers = [1, 2, 3].
#To define a tuple, we just need to replace the brackets with parentheses () like this: (1, 2, 3).
#From both data types, we can access elements by index and we can iterate over them.
#The main difference is that tuple cannot be changed once it is defined.
